    "In this notebook, you'll build self-attention from scratch to understand the mechanism that revolutionized natural language processing. Rather than treating attention as a black box, you'll see exactly how it computes relationships between words, why it's so powerful, and how it learns to focus on relevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention is the core innovation that enables models like BERT, GPT, and other transformers to understand language. By the end of this notebook, you'll have implemented the same attention mechanism used in these state-of-the-art models, working through simple examples to build deep intuition about how and why it works.\n",

This small scale lets you trace through every computation and truly understand what's happening inside the attention mechanism.\n\nAs part of this process, you'll build a vocabulary that includes:\n- A **padding token** (`<pad>`) for making all sequences the same length in a batch\n- An **unknown token** (`<unk>`) to handle any rare or out-of-vocabulary words the model might encounter\n\nThese special tokens are essential for handling real-world text where sequences vary in length and new words may appear during inference.\n\nLet's begin!"

    "## 2 - Manual Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you'll dig into the heart of what makes Transformers powerful: **self-attention**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Self-Attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention is a mechanism that allows each word in a sequence to \"look at\" and \"gather information from\" every other word, including itself. Unlike traditional sequential models that process words one by one, self-attention computes relationships between all words simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way: when you read the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat because it was tired,\" your brain automatically knows that \"it\" refers to \"cat.\" Self-attention gives neural networks this same capability to understand relationships and dependencies between words, no matter how far apart they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Self-Attention Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how self-attention transforms a sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"The cat sat\"\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "   [Embeddings]\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "   Q, K, V Projections\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "   Attention Scores (Q × K^T)\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "   Attention Weights (Softmax)\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "   Weighted Sum (Weights × V)\n",
    "         ↓\n",
    "Output: Context-aware representations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention operates through three learned transformations of your input:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Queries (Q)**: \"What information am I looking for?\"\n",
    "   - Each word generates a query vector representing what it wants to know\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keys (K)**: \"What information do I contain?\"\n",
    "   - Each word generates a key vector advertising what information it has\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Values (V)**: \"What information will I actually provide?\"\n",
    "   - Each word generates a value vector containing its actual contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Attention Computation Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step 1: Linear Projections\n",
    "Input → W_Q → Queries\n",
    "Input → W_K → Keys  \n",
    "Input → W_V → Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Similarity Scores\n",
    "Scores = Q × K^T / √d_k\n",
    "(How relevant is each word to every other word?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Attention Weights  \n",
    "Weights = Softmax(Scores)\n",
    "(Convert scores to probabilities)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Weighted Aggregation\n",
    "Output = Weights × V\n",
    "(Combine values based on attention weights)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence \"The cat sat\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attention Weight Matrix:\n",
    "        The   cat   sat\n",
    "The   [0.6   0.3   0.1]  ← \"The\" pays most attention to itself\n",
    "cat   [0.2   0.7   0.1]  ← \"cat\" focuses mainly on itself  \n",
    "sat   [0.1   0.3   0.6]  ← \"sat\" attends to \"cat\" and itself\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row shows where that word \"looks\" for information\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, these attention patterns become more sophisticated:\n",
    "- \"sat\" might learn to strongly attend to \"cat\" (the subject)\n",
    "- Articles like \"the\" might distribute attention more evenly\n",
    "- Pronouns would learn to attend to their antecedents\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Self-Attention is Powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parallel Processing**: Unlike RNNs, all positions are processed simultaneously\n",
    "2. **Long-Range Dependencies**: Can directly connect distant words without sequential steps\n",
    "3. **Interpretability**: Attention weights show what the model is \"looking at\"\n",
    "4. **Flexibility**: Learns task-specific attention patterns automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "Step by step, you'll implement each part of the self-attention formula—projections, dot products, scaling, softmax, and the final weighted sum—all by hand. This careful, explicit walkthrough will help you truly understand how self-attention works under the hood. Start slow here; later on, you'll see how these same ideas power much more complex, real-world NLP models!"

    "### 2.2 Self-Attention with Position Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attention is Position-Blind\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention lets each word \"look at\" every other word in the sequence—but on its own, it treats the input like an unordered set of words. The attention mechanism itself has no inherent notion of sequence or position. Consider these two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"The cat chased the dog\"\n",
    "- \"The dog chased the cat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Without position information, self-attention would produce identical representations for both sentences since they contain the same words! This is clearly wrong—word order fundamentally changes meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Solution: Adding Position Information\n",
    "\n",
    "To help the model distinguish word order, you give it a **positional embedding**: a unique vector for each position in the input sequence. These position vectors act like GPS coordinates for words, telling the model not just *what* each word is, but *where* it appears in the sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Word Embedding:     [cat] → [0.2, 0.5, -0.1, ...]  (what the word means)\n",
    "Position Embedding: [pos 2] → [0.1, -0.3, 0.4, ...]  (where it appears)\n",
    "                           ↓\n",
    "Combined Input:     [0.3, 0.2, 0.3, ...]  (meaning + position)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding position embeddings to word embeddings, you create position-aware representations that allow self-attention to learn different patterns based on word order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learned vs. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: In this notebook, you're using **learned positional embeddings** (`nn.Embedding`) - this is the approach shown in the course lectures. The model learns the best position representations during training, just like it learns word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in future notebooks (starting with the Encoder lab), you'll see an alternative approach: **sinusoidal positional encodings**. Instead of learning position embeddings, sinusoidal encodings use fixed mathematical functions (sine and cosine waves at different frequencies) to represent positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches work well, but they have different trade-offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learned Embeddings** (used in this lab):\n",
    "- Flexible and can adapt to your specific data patterns\n",
    "- Simple to understand and implement\n",
    "- Limited to the maximum sequence length seen during training\n",
    "- Require `max_len × d_model` parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sinusoidal Encodings** (used in later labs):\n",
    "- Fixed mathematical pattern that extends infinitely—can handle sequences longer than seen during training\n",
    "- Zero learnable parameters—the encodings are completely deterministic\n",
    "- Enable the model to easily learn relative positions (e.g., \"3 words to the left\")\n",
    "- Different frequencies capture both fine-grained (nearby words) and coarse-grained (distant words) relationships\n",
    "- Have become the standard in modern transformer implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "For this introduction to attention, learned embeddings are simpler to understand and work perfectly fine for our fixed-length sequences. You'll explore sinusoidal encodings in depth in the next lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Complete Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below implements a complete position-aware attention model with four key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Token Embeddings** (`tok_embed`): Converts token IDs to semantic vectors capturing word meaning\n",
    "2. **Position Embeddings** (`pos_embed`): Learnable vectors for each position (1st word, 2nd word, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Self-Attention** (`attn`): Computes context-aware representations using the manual attention from earlier\n",
    "4. **Output Projection** (`fc`): Maps the final hidden state to vocabulary size for next-word prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward pass:\n",
    "1. Generates position indices (0, 1, 2, ...) for each token in the batch\n",
    "2. Looks up both word and position embeddings\n",
    "3. Sums them together (this is how position information gets injected)\n",
    "4. Applies self-attention to these position-aware embeddings\n",
    "5. Takes the last position's output to predict the next word\n",
    "6. Projects to vocabulary size to get prediction scores\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture demonstrates the minimal components needed for a position-aware language model—the foundation that, when scaled up with multiple layers and heads, becomes the transformer models powering modern NLP."

   "source": "In the input sequence—\"the dog chased the\"—the model starts by assigning relatively even attention to all tokens, meaning each word's new representation is influenced by almost all other words. This is shown in the first (before training) map, where each row has smoothly distributed blues, and no single cell stands out.\n\nHowever, after training, the map changes dramatically: you see much darker squares in particular positions of each row. For example, the first \"the\" might now strongly attend to \"dog\" while \"dog\" might heavily attend to \"chased\" and so on. What this means is that the model has learned, through exposure to many sentence patterns, that certain words in this context are especially important for predicting or understanding others. \n\nIn practical terms:  \n- When the model processes \"the\" it recognizes from training that \"dog\" is the most relevant context in this position—perhaps because \"the dog\" is a frequent phrase structure.\n- When it processes \"dog\" it attends more strongly to \"chased\" learning that verbs often follow nouns in your data.\n- The strong attention from the last \"the\" to \"dog\" (or \"chased\" depending on weights) reflects the model's understanding of typical sentence continuations in this specific dataset.\n\nSo, this focused attention after training visually confirms that the self-attention mechanism has picked up on real relationships in your sentence structure, allowing the model to make smarter predictions by leveraging learned language patterns, not just treating all words equally."

    "- You implemented self-attention both manually and using PyTorch’s powerful `nn.MultiheadAttention` layer, learning exactly how these models “pay attention” to context.\n",
    "- You trained your model on real Shakespearean language, and were able to generate new text—sometimes even capturing the style and rhythm of the Bard himself!\n",

    "By working hands-on with both custom and built-in attention, you gained a deep understanding of what makes transformers so effective in modern NLP:\n",

    "- The scalability and practicality of using optimized library components;\n",
    "- The importance of good data preparation and robust, interpretable generation.\n",
